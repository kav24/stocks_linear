Data exploration:

ggplot(data = stocks, mapping = aes(y = close, x = open)) +

Check multicolinearity for continours variables.
```{r}
sapply(stocks, typeof)
temp <- stocks[,3:7]
corrplot(cor(temp[, -5]), type = "upper")
```
Select the best variables to describe the model.
```{r}
stocks.best.subset.bic <-bestglm(temp, 
                              IC = "BIC", 
                              method = "exhaustive", 
                              TopModels = 1, 
                              family = binomial)
summary(stocks.best.subset.bic$BestModel)
```
```{r}
stocks.logistic <- glm(data = stocks, close ~ high +  low,
                    family = binomial(link= "logit")) 
summary(stocks.logistic)
```
Check the linearity assumption
```{r}

scatter.smooth(x = stocks$low, y = as.numeric(stocks$close) - 1, 
               pch = 19, xlab = "Low", ylab = "Close")
temp <- as.numeric(stocks$high)
scatter.smooth(x = temp, y = as.numeric(stocks$close) - 1, 
               pch = 19, xlab = "Low", ylab = "Close")
```

Check for possible outliers
```{r}
stocks.dffits <- data.frame("dffits" = dffits(stocks.logistic))
stocks.dffits$obs <- 1:length(stocks$close)

ggplot(data = stocks.dffits) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = obs, y = abs(dffits))) + 
  geom_hline(mapping = aes(yintercept = 1), 
             color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)

stocks.dffits[abs(stocks.dffits$dffits) >1,]
```

Check for multicolinearity
```{r}
stocks.vifs <- vif(stocks.logistic)
stocks.vifs
mean(stocks.vifs)
```

Model accuracy in representing the data
```{r}
like.ratio <- stocks.logistic$null.deviance - stocks.logistic$deviance
like.ratio
pchisq(like.ratio, 4, lower.tail = FALSE)
